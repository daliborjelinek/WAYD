# WAYD (What are youd doing)

WAYD is a Android application written in kotlin, which helps analyze the user informations about how much time daily he spends with choosen activities and the causes it has on his finances(positive or negative). The outcome will provide feedback on the ways how to be more effective.

## Aplication interface
 - ### Activity list
        List of all activities with basic statistics ( Amount of time spended with activity, total cost/income of activity ) 
 - ### Activity editor
        Allows user to add, update and delete activity/ies. Each activity has its own:
            - name
            - color
            - value/activity or value/hour  either positive or negative
            - state on/off
            - alert to be turned on/off
 - ### Activity widget
        Widget with buttons where each button represents one activity. After pressing the activity is turned on/off
 - ### Activity log 
        Chronological list of all runing/past activities, in which it is possible to update activities or add them retrospectively.
 - ### Overview dashboard
        Dashboard showing statistics for given time frame


## Future development
 - ### Point system
    Because money is not everything, for some activities  e.g. (sport, selfstudy, procrastination) you can earn points positive/negative and therefore your time will not be evaluated only depending on money but on points as well. Allowing you to see if you were lazy.
